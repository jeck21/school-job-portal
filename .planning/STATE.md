# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Stack is Next.js 15 + Supabase (PostGIS) + Vercel per research
- [Roadmap]: All PA sources require HTML scraping (no public APIs found)
- [Roadmap]: Adapter pattern for sources (new source = new adapter)
- [01-01]: oklch color format for CSS variables (matching shadcn/ui v4 default)
- [01-01]: Plus Jakarta Sans as primary font
- [01-01]: Dark mode as default theme with system override

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- No PA job source has a public API; all require scraping with ToS/legal considerations
- Scraper fragility is a known risk; monitoring needed from early phases
